One of them forty years ago laughed at the phonograph, calling believers fools. Yet they themselves accept far more astonishing things: that Earth is a round sphere with fiery liquid inside its crust (as volcanoes prove), that right now we are hurtling at 370 km per second toward Capricornus, and much more."
