Without wanting to, such paradoxical mediums make odd displacements of objects, breakages, and so on, usually when everyone’s attention is elsewhere. The phenomena are normally noticed only by their results. Experiments are now being done to see if they can occur deliberately and in front of others. Such tests were recently carried out by the Hellenic Society of Psychophysiology with the newly revealed medium."

After a severe mental shock—losing her beloved father and sister at the same time—telekinetic phenomena began around her. Objects often left one room and appeared in another or turned up under other items, and so many similar incidents."

The attempt was to move a nautical compass and little spheres sealed beneath a metal bell. Miss Kleio tried persistently for many days and, as Mr. Tanagras confirmed, finally managed to move the compass needle."

After a few moments she managed to swing the compass needle without touching it up to 90 degrees—one quarter of the circle. This was repeated many times. At points she even turned the needle through a full circle."

When Kleio moved her hands to place her fingers under the table, the needle again made full circles. Afterwards the compass was placed under two glass covers; once more the result was the same, sometimes equally strong, sometimes weaker."
